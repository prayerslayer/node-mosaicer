The generated image looks like shit. Why is that?

* Wrong ordering of Q.all() and subsequent stitching? — **Most probably not**
* Too less images in test corpus? (~1000) — **Kind of**
    * It's more like too less colors.
* Incorrect behavior of thief? — **Nope**
    * It's just that some images are better suited to be a pixel than others.
